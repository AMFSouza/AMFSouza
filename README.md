- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMFSouza
- 👀 I’m interested in systems analysis, software development, systems enterprise architecture, Domain Driven Design and so on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java SpringBoot and Front-End technologies like React and Angular. I have a strong interest in NodeJs.
      Nowaday my skills have a focus in back-end: C#: .NetCore, Java, and NodeJs, although I know some front-ends, their framework, and technologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open projects, if possible.
- 📫 How to reach me: send e-mail to amfdeveloper@gmail.com
